# Final Project
Our project takes samples of the activities running, walking, speed walking, sitting, dancing and classifies each of the activities accordingly.

This image is an example confusion matrix, and each box corresponds to one of our five labels, the ground truth is the x-axis, predictions are y-axis and the color corresponds to how many are in each category. We also have a live portion of the app, hosted at https://group7-cs328.herokuapp.com that doesn't use the classifier but it uses filtering live and step counting live in order to convert the step rate to BPM and recommend a corresponding song.
